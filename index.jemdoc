== Philip Thompson

Associate Professor 

[https://portal.fgv.br/en FGV]'s [https://emap.fgv.br/en/school EMAp] School of Applied Mathematics

== Research interests 

The mathematical theory and applications of algorithms in stochastic optimization and statistical machine learning, including some aspects of high-dimensional statistics. My focus is on robust high-dimensional estimation and variants of stochastic gradient descent.
